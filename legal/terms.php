<h3>
<a id="b-account-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting" class="anchor" href="#b-account-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>B. Account Africa Trainovation Consulting</h3>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account;
 you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you
 may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for
your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or
using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>

<h4>
<a id="1-required-information" class="anchor" href="#1-required-information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Required Information</h4>

<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the
signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name,
 is optional, unless you are accepting these Africa Trainovation Consulting on behalf of a legal
entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity)
or if you opt for a <a href="#l-payment">paid account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>

<h4>
<a id="2-account-requirements" class="anchor" href="#2-account-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Account Requirements</h4>

<p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on Africa Trainovation Consulting's Service.</p>

<ul>
<li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by
"bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit
machine accounts:<br>
</li>
<li>A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who
accepts the Africa Trainovation Consulting on behalf of the account, provides a valid email
address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used
exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct
the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is
ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no
more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal
account.</li>
<li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free
account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's
fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>
<li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant
young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with
United States law. Africa Trainovation Consulting does not target our Service to children under
13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn
of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href="#m-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User’s account immediately</a>.
 If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your
country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible
for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
<li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may
 not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may
create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.</li>
<li>Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="3-user-account-security" class="anchor" href="#3-user-account-security" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. User Account Security</h4>

<p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our
 Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you
maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and
its security are up to you.</p>

<ul>
<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
under your account (even when content is posted by others who have
accounts under your account).</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
 password. Africa Trainovation Consulting cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
<li>You will promptly <a href="https://africatrainovationconsulting.com/contact">notify Africa Trainovation Consulting</a>
 if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our
Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your
password or account.</li>

<a id="4-additional-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting" class="anchor" href="#4-additional-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. Additional Africa Trainovation Consulting</h4>

<p>In some situations, third parties' Africa Trainovation Consulting may apply to your use of
Africa Trainovation Consulting. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Africa Trainovation Consulting
with its own Africa Trainovation Consulting or license agreements; you may download an
application that integrates with Africa Trainovation Consulting; or you may use Africa Trainovation Consulting to
authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Africa Trainovation Consulting
are our full agreement with you, other parties' Africa Trainovation Consulting govern their
relationships with you.</p>

</ul>

<h4>

<h4>
<a id="5-scraping" class="anchor" href="#5-scraping" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5. Scraping</h4>

<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated
process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the
collection of information through Africa Trainovation Consulting's API. Please see <a href="#h-api-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting">Section H</a> for our API Africa Trainovation Consulting. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>

</ul>

<p>You may not scrape Africa Trainovation Consulting for spamming purposes, including for the

<p>All use of Africa Trainovation Consulting data gathered through scraping must comply with the <a href="https://africatrainovationconsulting.com/site/privacy">Africa Trainovation Consulting Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

<h4>
<a id="6-privacy" class="anchor" href="#6-privacy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6. Privacy</h4>

<p>Misuse of Africa Trainovation Consulting Users' Personal Information is prohibited.</p>

 particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal

<a id="7-excessive-bandwidth-use" class="anchor" href="#7-excessive-bandwidth-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h4>

<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in

<h4>
<a id="8-user-protection" class="anchor" href="#8-user-protection" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>8. User Protection</h4>

<p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our

<h3>
<a id="d-user-generated-content" class="anchor" href="#d-user-generated-content" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>D. User-Generated Content</h3>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but
you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the
content you post. You still have control over your content, and
responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those
we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or
close accounts if we need to.</em></p>

<h4>
<a id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content" class="anchor" href="#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>

<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the
Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm
 resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link
to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form
of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse
 of your User-Generated Content.</p>

<h4>
<a id="2-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-may-remove-content" class="anchor" href="#2-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-may-remove-content" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Africa Trainovation Consulting May Remove Content</h4>

<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right
(though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated
Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any  Africa Trainovation Consulting or
policies.</p>

<h4>
<a id="3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants" class="anchor" href="#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h4>

<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or
own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create
yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible
 for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you
have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third
party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>

<p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content,
we need you to grant us — and other Africa Trainovation Consulting Users — certain legal
permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to
 Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license
granting Africa Trainovation Consulting the permissions we need to run our Service, no
additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive
 any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The
licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our
servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>

<h4>
<a id="4-license-grant-to-us" class="anchor" href="#4-license-grant-to-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. License Grant to Us</h4>

<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish
it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to
store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as
necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes
the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups;
show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or
otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and
perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>

<p>This license does not grant Africa Trainovation Consulting the right to sell Your Content or
otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>

<h4>
<a id="5-license-grant-to-other-users" class="anchor" href="#5-license-grant-to-other-users" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>

<p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues,
comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed
by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree
 to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that
others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in
repositories they control).</p>

<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you
grant each User of Africa Trainovation Consulting a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use,
display, and perform Your Content through the Africa Trainovation Consulting Service and to
reproduce Your Content solely on Africa Trainovation Consulting as permitted through Africa Trainovation Consulting's
functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further
rights if you <a href="https://help.africatrainovationconsulting.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository">adopt a license</a>.
 If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are
responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under
Africa Trainovation Consulting that grant these permissions to other Africa Trainovation Consulting Users.</p>

<h4>
<a id="6-contributions-under-repository-license" class="anchor" href="#6-contributions-under-repository-license" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6. Contributions Under Repository License</h4>

<p>Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of
 a license, you license your contribution under the same Africa Trainovation Consulting, and you
agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those
Africa Trainovation Consulting. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions
under different Africa Trainovation Consulting, such as a contributor license agreement, that
agreement will supersede.</p>

<p>Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as
 the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the
 shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.</p>

<h4>
<a id="7-moral-rights" class="anchor" href="#7-moral-rights" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7. Moral Rights</h4>

<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish,
 or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity
 and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to
assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights
granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>
