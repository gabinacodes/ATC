<p>If you're <strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the
same basic information that most websites collect. We use common
internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is
stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>

<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes
 the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site,
additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor
request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information
like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>

<p>If you <strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic
information at the time of account creation. You will create your own
user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account.
You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and
 this may include "User Personal Information."</p>

<p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users
 which could, alone or together with other information, personally
identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an
email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User
Personal Information.”</p>

<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally
 identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally
identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website
and service.</p>

<p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>,
 such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or
religious information. Although Africa Trainovation Consulting does not request or intentionally
 collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might
store this kind of information in your account, such as in a account.
 If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are
 consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are
 in the United States.</p>

<p>We do not intentionally collect information that is <strong>stored in your repositories</strong>
 or other free-form content inputs. Information in your repositories
belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making
sure that your content complies with our <a href="https://help.africatrainovationconsulting.com/articles/Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>. Africa Trainovation Consulting employees <a href="https://help.africatrainovationconsulting.com/articles/Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-security/#employee-access">do not access private repositories unless required to</a> for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, with the consent of the account owner.</p>

<p>If your account is public, anyone (including us) may view its
contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your
public account, such as email addresses, that information may be
indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while
we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan
 our servers for certain tokens or security signatures.</p>

<p>If you're a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not
have an account on Africa Trainovation Consulting. Africa Trainovation Consulting does not knowingly collect information
 from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If
 we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the
 age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't
want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules.
Please see our <a href="https://help.africatrainovationconsulting.com/articles/Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> for information about account termination.</p>

<a id="how-we-share-the-information-we-collect" class="anchor" href="#how-we-share-the-information-we-collect" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How we share the information we collect</h3>

<p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>

<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Africa Trainovation Consulting, except
in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on <a href="#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure">Compelled Disclosure</a>.</p>

<p>We <strong>do</strong> share certain aggregated, non-personally
identifying information with others about how our users, collectively,
use Africa Trainovation Consulting, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our
 conferences or events. For example, we may <a href="https://africatrainovationconsulting.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-com">compile statistics on the usage of open source licenses across Africa Trainovation Consulting</a>. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>

<p>We do not host advertising on Africa Trainovation Consulting. We may occasionally embed
content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may
include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded
content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of
third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve
our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our
own Privacy Statement. Our vendors perform services such as payment
processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and
other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under <a href="https://help.africatrainovationconsulting.com/articles/Africa-Trainovation-Consulting-privacy-statement/#Africa Trainovation Consultings-global-privacy-practices">Privacy Shield</a>, we remain responsible for it.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a
merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens,
we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality
of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or
by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The
organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor
any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of
Service.</p>

<a id="public-information-on-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting" class="anchor" href="#public-information-on-Africa-Trainovation-Consulting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Public Information on Africa Trainovation Consulting</h4>

<p>Much of Africa Trainovation Consulting is public-facing. If your content is public-facing,
third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of
Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow
third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile
public-facing Africa Trainovation Consulting information.</p>

<p>Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be
gathered by third parties in these compilations of Africa Trainovation Consulting data. If you
do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’
compilations of Africa Trainovation Consulting data, please do not make your Personal
Information publicly available and be sure to <a href="https://africatrainovationconsulting.com/settings/emails">configure your email address to be private in your user profile</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to compile Africa Trainovation Consulting data, you may only use any
public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which
our user has authorized it. For example, where a Africa Trainovation Consulting user has made an
 email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and
attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising.
We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have
gathered from Africa Trainovation Consulting, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal
requests, and "do not contact" requests from Africa Trainovation Consulting or Africa Trainovation Consulting users.</p>

<p>Similarly, projects on Africa Trainovation Consulting may include publicly available Personal
 Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the
event that a Africa Trainovation Consulting project contains publicly available Personal
Information that does not belong to Africa Trainovation Consulting users, we will only use that
Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected,
 and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any
User Personal Information. If you have a complaint about any Personal
Information on Africa Trainovation Consulting, please see our section on <a href="#resolving-complaints">resolving complaints</a>.</p>

<h4>
<a id="cookies" class="anchor" href="#cookies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cookies</h4>

<p>Africa Trainovation Consulting uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and
meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5
localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and
provide information for future development of Africa Trainovation Consulting.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your
computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you
return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are
merely visiting Africa Trainovation Consulting; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier
for each logged in user. The cookies Africa Trainovation Consulting sets are essential for the
operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality.
By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies
 on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s
ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use
Africa Trainovation Consulting’s services.</p>

<h4>
<a id="google-analytics" class="anchor" href="#google-analytics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Google Analytics</h4>

<p>We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we
don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal
Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how
our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and
 use Africa Trainovation Consulting. This helps us evaluate our users' use of Africa Trainovation Consulting; compile
statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website
performance.</p>

<p>Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying
information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet
service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data
 about your use of Africa Trainovation Consulting. We do not link this information to any of
your personal information such as your user name.</p>

<p>Africa Trainovation Consulting will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google
 Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User
Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address
 with your identity. Google provides further information about its own
privacy practices and offers a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking</a>.</p>

<p>Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For
example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that
sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we
can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p>

<h4>
<a id="tracking" class="anchor" href="#tracking" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tracking</h4>

<p>"<a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a>" is a privacy
preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online
services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your
online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your
 online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do
not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site
beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.
 Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or
permit this kind of third party data collection on Africa Trainovation Consulting for any of our
 users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves,
 we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not
 Track setting.</p>

<p>If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a> website has browser-specific instructions.</p>

 of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry
standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both

<p><strong>Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the United States</strong>
 in accordance with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that
we have users from different countries and regions with different
privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs.</p>

<p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users
around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and
 we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security,
 data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a
Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data
privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if
our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they
 must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy
laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard
Contractual Clause agreements.</p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Africa Trainovation Consulting provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at
the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data.</li>
<li>  We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary,
unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the
amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>
<li>  We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected.</li>
<li>  We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and
 access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our
users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield
 Principles, but they are also just good practices.</li>
<li>  Africa Trainovation Consulting adheres to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield Framework</a>. You may view our entry in the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001K2AAI">Privacy Shield List</a>.
 In addition to providing our users methods of unambiguous, informed
consent and control over their data, we participate in and comply with
the Privacy Shield framework, and we are committed to subject any
Personal Information we receive from the EU and EEA to the Privacy
Shield Principles. In addition, we continue to participate in the Safe
Harbor Framework for Swiss data transfers to the US. Please read more

<p>In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Africa Trainovation Consulting
regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our
 best to resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected JAMS, an independent
 dispute resolution provider, to handle unresolved Privacy Shield

 effort to address them, you may <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim">contact JAMS and submit a Privacy Shield claim</a>.
 JAMS is a US-based private alternate dispute resolution provider, and
we have contracted with JAMS to provide an independent recourse
mechanism for any of our users for privacy concerns <strong>at no cost to you.</strong>
 You do not need to appear in court; you may conduct this dispute
resolution process via telephone or video conference. If you are not
based in the EU or EEA, but you would still like to use the JAMS
arbitration process to resolve your dispute, please let us know and we
will provide access to you.</p>

<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Africa Trainovation Consulting
strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable
effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we
